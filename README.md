# trimedia-testing-page
so we are clear on what needs to be done:

you can use this repo to test and see if what you created will work on the final site - if it works here it will work there.

1) make sure that no matter where the cursor is on the page JQuery will scroll when the user scrolls (just like the origional page)

2) get the bottom border anamation for the "Para personas digitales" working 

3) have your project be able to fit nicely into a container with these dimentions:
  width: 600px;
  height: 582;
